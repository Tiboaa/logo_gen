The logo text '{text_0}' is a modern cyberpunk style that has missing vertical lines from the letters if the letter is still readable without it. Under the logo on the bottom right there is a lowercase text '{text_1}' colored {text_clr_0}, using a {font} font. The overall design should feel sleek, tech-forward, and unique. The logo is only text not images.",
