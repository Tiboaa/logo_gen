  "inputs": "A bold, minimalist typographic logo on a white background. The text {text_0} is written in thick, {text_clr_0} {font} capital letters. The characters are so close to each other that they are overlapping a little. Some of the overlapping letters are designed using negative space: instead of being fully drawn, only its defining elements are suggested by horizontal gaps between the surrounding letters. This creates a clever illusion where the full word remains readable, but the some characters stands out as modern, geometric, and abstract forms. The style is clean, professional, and highly legible with strong contrast.",
