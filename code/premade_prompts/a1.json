  "inputs": "Minimalistic modern logo with white background. Bold white futuristic capital letter {letter} in the center of a vibrant {shape_ular} gradient background ({subject_clr_0} to {subject_clr_1}), this gives a 3D effect. {shape} has abstract bubble-like extensions (they differ in size) on the top left, some of them fuse with the main {shape}. Below the {shape} separate from it, there are two lines of text: first line in {text_clr_0} uppercase that says {text_0}, second line in smaller {text_clr_1} uppercase it says {text_1}. So the logo is the {shape} with an{letter}inside it and two lines of text under it the font of the texts is {font}. Clean, professional, futuristic, high-quality flat vector style, {font} font, simple and sharp. The background is white!",
