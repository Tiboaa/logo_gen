The thin {subject_clr_0} line-art is one simple UNBROKEN line that can be drawn without breaking up the line (or picking up the pen). Under the clean, modern line-art logo there is a text: '{text_0}' colored {text_clr_0} and under that a smaller text: '{text_1}' colored {text_clr_0}. For the texts use the font {font}! Simple flat design, professional branding aesthetic, balanced composition.",
