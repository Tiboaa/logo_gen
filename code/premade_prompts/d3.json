  "inputs": "A modern geometric logo spelling out the text {text_0} on a {subject_clr_1} background, designed with bold abstract shapes, bright gradients, and smooth shading. The letters are thick bearly resembling to the actual letters. The text says '{text_0}'. Each letter is a given color. The letters are made up of simple shapes like rectangles, squares, circles, half circles and triangles, the other shapes are derived of it. The style is minimal, playful, and futuristic, with each letter constructed from simple geometric forms that fit together harmoniously. The design should use vibrant contrasting colors ({subject_clr_0}) against a solid {subject_clr_1} background, giving a clean, sleek, and contemporary feel.",
