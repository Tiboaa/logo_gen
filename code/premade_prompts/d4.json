The logo text '{text_0}' is a modern simple but stylish font that is thick. The color of the text is changed inside an invisible {shape} from {subject_clr_0} to {subject_clr_1}. The overall design should feel sleek, tech-forward, and unique. The logo is only text with the color difference not images.",
