  "inputs": "Create a modern, minimalist logo on a white background featuring a really stylized and super simple or abstract {shape} shape in gradient {subject_clr_0} tones. Right next to it there is a {shape_2} shape that appears connected to the original {shape} shape, {shape_2} is colored {subject_clr_0} but with the gradient going the other way as the {shape}. Next to the logo there is a lowercase text '{text_0}' in {text_clr_0}, using a {font} font, the text isn't small compared to the logo and is close enough to be part of the logo. The overall design should feel sleek, tech-forward, and unique.",
